- each image has a tag and attribute. 
- Only one image with a given tag can be shown at the same time.

  scene {image} - clears all images and displays a background image. 
  show {image} - shows a sprite on top of the background, and changes the displaying sprite
  hide {image} - hides the image (used when character leaves but scene doesn't change)
  image {attribute tag} = "image.png" - used to define attribute tag. Renpy does this automatically
